# AI-Virtual-Mouse
The AI-Powered Virtual Mouse is a touchless system that redefines traditional human-computer interaction by using artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques. This innovative technology enables users to control a computer cursor using hand gestures, eliminating the need for a physical mouse.
The system captures real-time video input through a standard webcam, processes it using machine learning algorithms, and recognizes gestures to perform actions such as moving the cursor, clicking, and dragging. By leveraging libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe, the virtual mouse ensures high accuracy in gesture detection and low latency in execution.
Designed with accessibility in mind, this system benefits individuals with physical disabilities and provides a hygienic alternative in environments where physical contact is undesirable, such as healthcare or public terminals. The project explores various applications, including gaming, touchless kiosks, and remote system controls, showcasing its versatility.
This report outlines the system's design, implementation, and performance analysis, addressing the challenges faced during development, such as gesture recognition accuracy under varying lighting conditions and computational efficiency. The findings reveal significant potential for AI-powered virtual mice to revolutionize user interaction while paving the way for future advancements in gesture-based technology.
